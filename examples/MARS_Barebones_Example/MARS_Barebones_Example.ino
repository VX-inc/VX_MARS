 *
 * This is an example sketch for use with the barebones MARS Module.  
 * 
 * This sketch requires the base headset and at least 1 CNED installed.
 * 
 * This application demonstrates the following:
 * - Ambient light sensor for CNED brightness control
 * - Serial port communication for system state
 * 
 * Please do not manipulate the individual ports without knowledge, this could cause damage
 * to the hardware.
