# VX_MARS

## Introduction
The VX modular augmented reality system (MARS) is available as a complete AR reference design. The MARS is a tested system that was designed to reduce lead time and development risk for new headset designs. A ready to manufacture package is available for users that have specific applications in mind.

MARS offers everything needed for USB Type-C PD negotiation, sensor integration, and onboard data processing for plug-n-play accessory modules. The reference supports two FHD CNED displays, 5 Gbit/s data bus, high-speed multiplexing, and full device control via the serial, MIPI, and I2C interfaces.

## Firmware Integration
The MARS has a dedicated application microcontroller (ATMEGA32U4) designed to allow the user to program system functionality specific to their needs. The microcontroller is programmable over USB through the main device USB-C port. 

  Microcontroller can interface with:
  * Backlight brightness control 
  * Modules
  * Ambient Light Sensor (ALS)
  * USB Serial Port
